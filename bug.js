This error typically occurs when you try to import a module that's not correctly installed or isn't accessible within your project's structure.  It can manifest in different ways depending on the specific module and your Expo setup.  For example, you might see variations like `Cannot find module 'react-native-xyz'`, where 'react-native-xyz' is the problematic module.
