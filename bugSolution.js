The solution depends on the root cause:

**1. Missing or Incorrect Installation:**
   - **Verify Installation:** Ensure the module is installed using `expo install <module-name>`.  Use `yarn add <module-name>` if you prefer Yarn.
   - **Check Package.json:** Confirm that the module is correctly listed in your `package.json` file's `dependencies` section.
   - **Clean Install:** As a last resort, try deleting your `node_modules` folder and re-running `expo install` or `yarn install` to ensure a clean installation.

**2. Incorrect Import Path:**
   - **Relative Paths:** Use relative paths from the file's location to import modules within your project (e.g., `import MyComponent from './components/MyComponent';`).
   - **Absolute Paths:** Avoid absolute paths unless absolutely necessary; relative paths are cleaner and less prone to errors.

**3. Mismatched Module Name:** Double-check that the name of the module in your `import` statement exactly matches the name of the package installed.

**4. Expo Environment:**
   - **Managed Workflow:** Verify the correct version of the modules are compatible with Expo's managed workflow.  Some native modules might not be supported.
   - **Bare Workflow:** If you're using the Bare workflow, you might need to configure the native project correctly.

**Example Solution (bugSolution.js):**
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Text } from 'react-native'; // This assumes react-native is properly installed

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Text>This is a corrected import.</Text>
  );
}
```

By addressing these points and examining your module installation and import statements, you can effectively solve this "Unable to resolve module" error in your Expo projects.
